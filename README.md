# Haskell Sort Function Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to Haskell's `sort` function. While seemingly straightforward for simple numerical lists, the function's behavior can be unexpected when dealing with lists containing duplicate elements or more complex data types.

The `bug.hs` file contains examples illustrating this unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.hs` file offers a potential solution to handle these cases more robustly.

## Problem

Haskell's `sort` function, as implemented in `Data.List`, relies on the default ordering of elements. This can lead to surprising results when:

1.  **Duplicate elements:**  Sorting a list containing duplicates results in preserving the original order of those duplicates. This can be counterintuitive when you expect a canonical sorted order.
2.  **Complex data types:** If the list elements are complex types (e.g., custom data structures), the `sort` function's behavior depends heavily on the `Ord` instance implementation for that type.  An improperly defined `Ord` instance can cause incorrect sorting.

## Solution

The solution, outlined in `bugSolution.hs`, often involves creating a custom sorting function that addresses specific needs, such as enforcing a particular order for duplicate elements or providing a tailored comparison function for complex data types.
